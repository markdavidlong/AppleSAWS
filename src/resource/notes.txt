### Welcome

This is a toolkit for exploring DOS 3.3 disk images and their contents. I started this because
I had become interested in a game that I used to play a long time ago and I
wanted to dig deeper into the internals of how it worked. Since it was a nice
combination of a series of Applesoft and Binary files, I decided that a tool
to help explore those types of things would be handy. Of course, I've ended
up spending far more time writing the tool than I have actually exploring the
game, but nonetheless, it's been a fun ongoing project.
